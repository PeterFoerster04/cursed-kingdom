CURSED KINGDOM:
A demo for a low poly fantasy game, where the main character finds in a cursed world on a quest to brew potions 
and heal the villagers. The game features immersive sound design to enhance the experience.

This project was my first experience working on an Unreal project as part of a team, 
with a emphasis on team management, time management, and project planning.

This game demo was developed using Unreal Engine 5.4, 
with GitHub serving as the version control system for collaborative efforts on project.

Project Highlights:

The demo was designed with immersive audio and music, changing the auditive experience in each area of the open world. 
In the open world, you can discover the ingredients necessary for brewing healing potions for the villagers.
Each potion requires three primary ingredients and one unique ingredient specific to the villager for effective healing.
